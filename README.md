# Employee Future Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of employees leaving a company. Using machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors, KMeans clustering the project explores the relationship between various employee attributes and the likelihood of attrition. The dataset is preprocessed to handle class imbalance and the best-performing model is used for predictions. The goal is to provide insights and predictions that can help organizations proactively identify potential employee turnover and take appropriate actions to retain valuable talent.
